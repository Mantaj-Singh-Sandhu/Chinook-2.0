# Chinook-2.0
Chinook 2.0 is Python-based software that can download a fleet's data of one client at a time, including all devices from Amazon, into one file with formats and separately show the out-of-range, stuck values, and errors. After running the app, set the date and click on one of the client buttons. The result will be saved in the Surprise Folder.
